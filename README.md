### Speech Emotion Recognition Project ###
Description
This project focuses on speech emotion recognition using datasets such as CREMA and RAVDESS. The primary goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify the emotions expressed in audio recordings of speech.

Datasets Used
CREMA: Contains a wide variety of emotional speech recordings.
RAVDESS: Includes speech and song recordings with diverse emotional expressions, featuring multiple actors.

2. Seprate Question  - Graddio Deployment for different type of 8 to 9 quetions on which prediction can be done
3. Large Audio -  its same as chunks but deployed on gradio


###### Requirment #####
As file size constrain cant upload model architecture and weights file.
To run all this you need this file necessarily.
